# Note: Documentation generation is handled by forge_cli using forge-etch directly.
# We can't add forge-etch as a dependency here due to cyclic dependency (forge-etch depends on forge-weld).
# When ExtensionBuilder.generate_docs() is used, it saves WeldModule JSON to OUT_DIR/docs/
# which forge_cli can later consume to generate documentation using forge-etch.
